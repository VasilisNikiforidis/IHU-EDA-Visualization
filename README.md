#### Intro
For this coursework we decided to use the Tableau software, after trying out some other Visualization tools, like Excel, Pythonâ€™s Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, etc, for Visualisation.

We searched for Data Sets from which we could draw conclusions to formulate either a decision or an observation. We ended up choosing the city of Chicago, where many data sets from a variety of domains were provided. 

From these domains we went with Crimes, Airbnb and Taxi trips, retrieved from different data repositories such as [dat.gov](https://www.data.gov/), [insideairbnb.com/get-the-data](insideairbnb.com/get-the-data) and [Google Cloud BigQuery Repository](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/) respectively. Using these sets, we draw conclusions for each individual domain, but we also found correlations between the datasets. 

These correlations are not absolute, since a result is not influenced by only one factor. Still, in some cases we can clearly see how a metric of one domain influences or not another domain.


#### Afterthoughts

After some slight configuration with the relationships between the data sources, Tableau was straightforward to use. Hovering over a graph type, one can immediately see what each graph needs to be produced, e.g. number of dimensions, dates, coordinates, etc. The only thing missing from this software, is the direct support for 3D-graphs, which would perhaps provide some more multifaceted Visualizations.
